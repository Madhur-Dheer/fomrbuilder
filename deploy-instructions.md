## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify MongoDB connection string
- Ensure all environment variables are set

### Frontend Issues
- Check Vercel function logs
- Verify API URLs in environment variables
- Test API endpoints directly

### CORS Issues
- Ensure ALLOW_ORIGIN matches your Vercel domain exactly
- Include both http and https if testing locally
